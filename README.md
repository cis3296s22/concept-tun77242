# Proof of Concept for PROJECT NAME 

During a crisis, there are often many people who want to help out but either don’t know what needs to be done or how to offer their services to those in need. On the flip side, those who find themselves in need often don’t have the connections to find the help or resources they require. The goal of the How Can I Help? application is to connect individuals and/or organizations who either want to donate goods or services or need goods or services. Users can request needs or notify what they could donate, and this application matches the requesting user with the available donor and provides details for their communication.
